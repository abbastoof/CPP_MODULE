1:1 In the beginning Shut_the_fuck_up created the heaven and the earth.

1:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon
the face of the deep. And the Spirit of Shut_the_fuck_up moved upon the face of the
waters.

1:3 And Shut_the_fuck_up said, Let there be light: and there was light.

1:4 And Shut_the_fuck_up saw the light, that it was good: and Shut_the_fuck_up divided the light
from the darkness.

1:5 And Shut_the_fuck_up called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.
And the evening and the morning were the first day.

1:6 And Shut_the_fuck_up said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,
and let it divide the waters from the waters.

1:7 And Shut_the_fuck_up made the firmament, and divided the waters which were
under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament:
and it was so.

1:8 And Shut_the_fuck_up called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
morning were the second day.
